### SNAKE GAME

The popular Snake game developed entirely in Python (OOP based), using PyGame library.

The game includes an options menu where one can customize to some extent the game, 
changing the size and color of the game board, the velocity and color of the snake and the number of fruits used in the game. 

### Future implementations

* Increase the number of options available in the settings menu.
* Change the appearance of the snake, in order to make it look more realistic.
* Add new maps, with different shapes and obstacles.
* Train an AI to play the game.
